# Decisions

## ADR-001: Repository-in-place with ignored originals

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Initialize Git in the current project folder and ignore original source folders and raw source spreadsheets.
- Rationale: The plan requires the current project folder as the primary workspace while protecting originals from modification and commits.

## ADR-002: Markdown and schema-first standards

- Date: 2026-07-13
- Status: accepted
- Decision: Canonical operating documents use required YAML front matter and predictable sections.
- Rationale: This matches the plan and keeps the first release maintainable without a custom platform.
